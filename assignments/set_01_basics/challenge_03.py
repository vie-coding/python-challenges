Challenge 3: Leap Year Checker
------------------------------
TODO:
1. Ask the user to enter a year (integer).
2. Determine if it is a leap year based on these rules:
   - A year IS a leap year if it is divisible by 4...
   - EXCEPT if it is divisible by 100 (then it is NOT a leap year)...
   - UNLESS it is ALSO divisible by 400 (then it IS a leap year).
3. Print "True" if it is a leap year, or "False" if it is not.

Examples:
    Input: 2000 -> Output: True
    Input: 1900 -> Output: False
    Input: 2024 -> Output: True
