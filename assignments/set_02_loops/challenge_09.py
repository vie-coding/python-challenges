Challenge 9: Prime Checker
-------------------------
TODO:
1. Ask the user to enter an integer N greater than 1.
2. Determine if N is a prime number.
3. Print "True" if N is prime, "False" if it is not.
4. If N is less than 2, print "invalid".
5. Remember: A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

    Output: True

    Input: 10
