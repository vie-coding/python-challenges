Challenge 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists
-----------------------------------
Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐

TODO:
1. You are given TWO lists that are already sorted in ascending order.
2. Merge them into ONE sorted list (also ascending).
3. You CANNOT use sort(), sorted(), or any built-in sorting.
4. The result must be sorted without using sort after merging.
5. Print the merged sorted list.

Example:
    Input: list1 = [1, 3, 5], list2 = [2, 4, 6]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    Input: list1 = [1, 2, 8, 10], list2 = [3, 5, 7]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]

    Input: list1 = [], list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    Output: [1, 2, 3]

    Input: list1 = [5], list2 = [1]
    Output: [1, 5]

Hint: Use two pointers, one for each list.
      Compare elements at both pointers.
      Add the smaller one to the result and move that pointer forward.
      Continue until both lists are exhausted.
